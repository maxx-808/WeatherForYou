Weather For You: on the go weather app that shows you the weather for the day and the next 5, get measurments like temperature, huimidity, and windspeed, as well as a look on how the weather will be for the day.

I could not figure out how to get the local storage back onto buttons that could run the calls for history stored cities, usually our teacher and TA's help people with pointers or tips at the end of class thurs and sat, but the project we are currently doing took up both of that. i got it to save to local storage and everything else seems to work.
